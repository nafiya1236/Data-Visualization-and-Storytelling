# Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling
**[Project 1:Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling](https://github.com/nafiya1236/Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling/blob/main/superstore%20sales%20data.pbix)**\

Superstore dataset is a popular fictional retail dataset that contains detailed information on customer orders, including order details, customer segments, regions, product categories, sales, discounts, and profits. In Power BI, I imported this dataset and explored key fields to understand sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior. I created key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX measures such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, and Average Discount, and displayed them using card visuals for easy interpretation. To enhance interactivity, I added slicers for fields like Region, Category, Segment, and Order Date, allowing dynamic filtering across all visuals. I selected the appropriate charts for effective storytelling, including a line chart for sales trends, bar and treemap visuals for category-wise performance, and a map to highlight regional insights. Following best practices in data visualization, I kept the visuals clean and focused, avoided clutter, highlighted key takeaways, and ensured that each chart added meaningful context. Overall, I created an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that emphasizes not just visuals but also delivers clear business insights through visual storytelling.
